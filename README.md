# Software Development Interview Preparation

A comprehensive collection of coding challenges, algorithm implementations, and interview preparation materials. This repository documents my journey to master technical interview skills through deliberate practice and structured learning. My preparation is organized into three tiers based on frequency and importance in technical interviews. This approach is inspired by [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.beyondctci.com/) with some personal modifications.

### [TIER 1 - Core Fundamentals](./tier-1-core)

These are the foundational concepts that appear most frequently in technical interviews and form the bedrock of computer science knowledge:

- [ ] **Arrays & Dynamic Arrays**: Implementation, manipulation, and common operations
- [ ] **String Manipulation**: Pattern matching, parsing, and transformation techniques
- [ ] **Two Pointers**: Solving problems with multiple pointers traversing data structures
- [ ] **Grids & Matrices**: 2D array traversal, transformation, and search algorithms
- [ ] **Binary Search**: Implementation and applications beyond simple sorted arrays
- [ ] **Hash Maps & Sets**: Utilizing hash-based data structures for efficient lookups
- [ ] **Stacks and Queues**: LIFO and FIFO data structures and their applications
- [ ] **Recursion**: Recursive problem solving, including base cases and recursive steps
- [ ] **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation and analysis of common sorting techniques
- [ ] **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists, operations, and common patterns
- [ ] **Trees**: Binary trees, BSTs, traversals, and recursive tree operations
- [ ] **Graphs**: Representation, traversal (BFS/DFS), and basic algorithms

### [TIER 2 - Important But Less Fundamental](./tier-2-important)

These topics are common in interviews but build upon the core fundamentals:

- [ ] **Heaps**: Implementation and applications in priority-based problems
- [ ] **Sliding Windows**: Fixed and variable size window techniques
- [ ] **Backtracking**: Systematic exploration of solution spaces
- [ ] **Topological Sort**: Ordering nodes in directed graphs
- [ ] **Prefix Sums**: Precomputation for efficient range queries
- [ ] **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization and tabulation approaches to optimization problems
- [ ] **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices for global solutions

### [TIER 3 - Advanced Topics](./tier-3)

These are specialized topics that demonstrate deeper computer science knowledge:

- [ ] **Monotonic Stacks & Queues**: Maintaining order properties in stack/queue operations
- [ ] **Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)**: Efficient grouping and merging of elements
- [ ] **Data Structure Design**: Creating custom data structures for specific problem domains
- [ ] **Set & Map Implementations**: Understanding the internals of hash-based collections
- [ ] **Tries**: Prefix trees for efficient string operations
- [ ] **Advanced Graph Algorithms**: Network flow, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths
- [ ] **Advanced Dynamic Programming**: 2D states, state compression, and complex optimizations
- [ ] **Bit Manipulation**: Bitwise operations and their algorithmic applications
- [ ] **Mathematical Algorithms**: Number theory, combinatorics, and probability

## Repository Organization

Each problem solution includes:

- Problem statement and constraints
- My approach with time and space complexity analysis
- Implementation in my preferred language(s)
- Key learnings and patterns identified

## Resources

Key resources I'm using in my preparation:

- LeetCode
- "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
- "Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview" also by Gayle
